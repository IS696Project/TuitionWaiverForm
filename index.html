            <p>The Tuition Waiver program is designed to enable eligible employees, their spouses, and their dependent children to enroll in courses at Eastern Michigan University with reduced tuition or no tuition charges. Documentation may be required in order to verify the relationship of the dependents, if that was not previously provided through the employee’s medical or dental plans.</p>
            <h2>Eligibility</h2>
            <p>The tuition waiver program requires that the employee, spouse or dependents are accepted and
                registered for classes prior to applying for the tuition waiver program. Eligibility to receive the
                tuition waiver is determined by the employee’s e-class and current date of hire. </p>

            <h2>Tuition Benefit</h2>
            <p>This program reimburses eligible employees only for tuition expenses not covered by any other source of educational assistance. Books, supplies, and fees (such as registration, graduation, library, student activities, lab fees, and all other mandatory fees) are not covered under this program. The tuition waiver benefit differs based the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) and several other factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Employee vs. Spouse/Dependents</li>
                <li>Undergraduate vs. Graduate vs. Doctoral studies</li>
                <li>Employee’s appointment – Full-time vs. Part-time (<b>Employees working less than 100% get a
                    reduced benefit; employees less than 50% appointment do not have access to this benefit.</b>)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Employees are normally required to take classes outside of their working hours. However, if the class
                meeting time falls during the normal workday, the <b>Working Hours Exception Agreement</b> must be signed by your supervisor and submitted with the application for tuition waiver.</p>

                <li><b>EMU is required to tax any tuition waiver amount exceeding $5,250 per calendar year for graduate and doctoral level classes.</b> Federal, State and FICA taxes will be posted on your paycheck over several pay periods at the end of each calendar year. Tax withholdings will be calculated by Payroll based on several factors including W-4 elections and regular annual salary.

            <h2>Financial Aid and the Tuition Waiver</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The tuition waiver benefit is separate from financial aid. If using financial aid in conjunction with a tuition waiver, please inform Financial Aid and Student Business Services so they can coordinate and apply both to your E-Bill in the proper order.</li>
                <li>If you are a Graduate Assistant or Doctoral Fellow, your tuition is paid through its own program, not the tuition waiver program. Please contact the Human Resources Office for details.</li>
                <li>A loan which must be paid back is not considered financial aid and can be combined with tuition waiver.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: center"><b>It is the responsibility of all employees using the Tuition Waiver benefit to
                know and
