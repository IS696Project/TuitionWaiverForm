## Please try to follow the below guidelines
- Keep all files under their folders (.php inside php folder, .js inside js folder and so on)
- For design consistancy, use the same style sheets files for all html code (style sheets are under css folder)
- Do not commit any changes unless you tested the code and ensure it is bugs free
- For simplicity, download GitHub for desktop (if you do not want to work with command line)
- **When coding, use meaningful variable names**
- **Add comments when you feel it is useful**
